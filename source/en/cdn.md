title: Use CDN

Recommended: [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npm.

It can also be obtained on [jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/valine/) and [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/valine) (cdnjs version may be slightly lagged behind).

## Specific version

``` html
<!-- do not set the version number -->
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
<!-- or set latest -->
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine@latest/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
<!-- or Default value -->
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine"></script>
```

## Latest version

``` html
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
```
